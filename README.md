# ATS Resume Scorer

A web app that scores how well a resume matches a job description and returns actionable feedback. Built with FastAPI + Streamlit, using spaCy and Sentence Transformers for NLP and the Groq API for LLM-generated suggestions.

## What it does

1. Upload a resume (PDF / DOC / DOCX) and paste a job description.
2. The backend parses the resume, extracts skills and experience, and compares them to the JD using semantic similarity.
3. You get an ATS score, a breakdown by category (formatting, keywords, content, skill validation, ATS compatibility), and LLM-written suggestions for what to improve.
4. Past analyses are saved to your account so you can revisit them.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **NLP:** spaCy (`en_core_web_md`), Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **LLM:** Groq API (Llama 3)
- **Auth + Database:** Supabase (email/password and Google OAuth)
- **PDF report export:** WeasyPrint + Jinja2

## Setup

### 1. Clone and create a virtual environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ATS_SCORER
python3 -m venv venvats
source venvats/bin/activate      # Windows: venvats\Scripts\activate
```

> Use the project’s actual virtual environment directory (`venvats`) — the repo includes that folder and the old `venv` path is not present here.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

WeasyPrint needs system libraries on Linux:

```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install -y cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2 libffi

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install -y libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0 libffi-dev
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Copy the templates and fill in your keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp frontend/.streamlit/secrets.toml.example frontend/.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

You need:

- A **Supabase** project — grab `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (service role), and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from Project Settings → API.
- A **Groq** API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com).
- (Optional) Google OAuth set up in the Supabase dashboard if you want Google sign-in.

The Streamlit frontend reads Supabase config from `frontend/.streamlit/secrets.toml`. The example file contains the required keys for local development.

### 4. Run the backend

From the project root:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API is now at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 5. Run the frontend

In a new terminal (with the venv activated):

```bash
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Notes for students

- **Never commit `.env` or `secrets.toml`** — they hold API keys. Both are in `.gitignore`; check before you push.
- The first run downloads the Sentence Transformer model (~80 MB). It's cached afterwards.
- If you don't have a Groq key yet, the scoring still works — only the LLM suggestions section will be empty.
- `jupyter notebooks/` and `ml model/` are for experimentation and aren't required to run the app.
